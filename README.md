# Syncord

## Description

Syncord is there to offer you a way of logging specific Events from within your SCP SL Server to your Discord Server.  
To make it short, Syncord supports:  
- Logging Events from multiple SL-Servers to one Discord-Server.
- Logging Events from one SL-Server to multiple Discord-Servers.
- Logging multiple Events into the same channel.

What Syncord doesn't support (yet):
- Logging SL-Server Events from a remote machine. (Bot & Server/s have to be on the same machine.)
