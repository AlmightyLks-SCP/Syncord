# Syncord

## Description

Syncord is there to offer you a way of logging specific Events from within your SCP SL Server to your Discord Server.  

Special thanks to [GrafDimenzio](https://github.com/GrafDimenzio) for persistently & patiently helping me out with making good use of the [Synapse-API](https://github.com/SynapseSL/Synapse/). ðŸ˜„

Another thanks to [Exiled's DI](https://github.com/galaxy119/DiscordIntegration/). Why?  
I was a noob at networking in programming before this project. I first looked at DI's implementations, learned a lot.  
However, these influences and inspirations in my code have been overhauled, removing a lot of associations, quirks and more importantly, making it more of my own creation.

## Configs

### SyncordBot

The default configs for the Discord Bot looks as following:  

```json
{
    "Prefix": "!",
    "BotToken": "Your Bot Token here",
    "Port": 8000,
    "Guilds": []
}
```
The `Prefix` is, as of yet, not important due to the Bot not having any commands as of this point.  
The `BotToken` shall be your own [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/).  
The `Port` shall be the Port which your Discord Bot runs on, as well as the Port that your Bot will be listening for requests on.  
Regarding the `Guilds`... The way a Guild-entry is structured is as following:  

```

{
    "GuildID": YourGuildID,
    "ServerPort": PortOfTheDedicatedServer,
    "DedicatedChannels": {
        EventName: ChannelIDForSpecificLog
    }
}
```
The valid Event Names can be found [here](https://github.com/AlmightyLks/Syncord/blob/main/EventNames.md). I am always open for suggestions!


Which could look something like this in completion:

```json
{
    "Prefix": "!",
    "BotToken": "Not this time",
    "Port": 8000,
    "Guilds": [
        {
            "GuildID": 727996170051518504,
            "ServerPort": 8888,
            "DedicatedChannels": {
                "Player Death": 782245173526134814,
                "Player Join": 782687511428333598,
                "Round Start Spawn": 782726617860014081,
                "Player Leave": 782687511428333598,
                "Console Command": 782730725035474944,
                "Remote Admin Command": 782730725035474944,
                "Player Ban": 783428874720772166
            }
        },
        {
            "GuildID": 727610880816316536,
            "ServerPort": 8888,
            "DedicatedChannels": {
                "Player Death": 727610980237836289
            }
        },
        {
            "GuildID": 727996170051518504,
            "ServerPort": 7777,
            "DedicatedChannels": {
                "Player Death": 782245173526134814,
                "Player Join": 782687511428333598,
                "Player Leave": 782687511428333598
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

That way you can combine multiple Discord-Servers with different SL-Servers, cross-logging events.  

### SyncordPlugin

Each server which you want to connect to your SyncordBot has to point towards the bot's port.

```yaml
[Syncord]
{
# Port which the Discord-Bot is listening to
discordBotPort: 8000
}
```

## How to Install

Download the files from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/AlmightyLks/Syncord/releases).  
The Bot only has to be unpacked and stay within its own folder (For your own good, and to make sure of the file integrity).  
It doesn't matter where you put the Bot-Folder, it only has to be on the same system.  
You need to have the `.NET Core 3.1 Runtime` installed.  
For Windows you can easily find it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-3.1.404-windows-x64-installer).  
For Linux you can find it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux).

For the Server-sided things... You move the `SyncordInfo.dll`, `System.Data.dll`\*, `DSharpPlus.dll`\* & the `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`\*, which are uploaded, into your Synapse\dependencies folder.  
After that, you simply move the `SyncordPlugin.dll` into your Server's plugin folder. Done!

---

## How to use

Using the `syncord.reconnect` permission and either the `Remote Admin Console` or the `Server Console`, you type `syncord connect` in order to connect to the local Syncord Bot.   
After that, you do not have to worry and you can leave the work to the Plugin and the Bot!



\* Note  
These files can be found in the dedicated Plugin-Channel within the [Synapse Discord](https://discord.gg/HWW6s8ggxT).
