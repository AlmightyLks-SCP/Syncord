## Description

Syncord is there to offer you a way of logging specific Events from within your SCP SL Server to your Discord Server.  

Special thanks to [GrafDimenzio](https://github.com/GrafDimenzio) for persistently & patiently helping me out with making good use of the [Synapse-API](https://github.com/SynapseSL/Synapse/). ðŸ˜„

Another thanks to [Exiled's DI](https://github.com/galaxy119/DiscordIntegration/). Why?  
I was a noob at networking in programming before this project. I first looked at DI's implementations, getting my hands on using network trafficing myself and learned a lot.  
However, these influences and inspirations in my code have been overhauled, removing a lot of associations, quirks and more importantly, making it more of my own creation.

## How to Install

Download the files from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/AlmightyLks/Syncord/releases).  
The Bot only has to be unpacked and stay within its own folder (For your own good, and to make sure of the file integrity).  
You do **not** have to install an additional runtime environment, hence the bot's size.  
It doesn't matter where you put the Bot-Folder.  

For the SL server-sided things... 
You move the dependencies\*, which are uploaded, into your Synapse-dependencies folder.  
After that, you simply move the `SyncordPlugin.dll` into your Server's plugin folder. Done!
